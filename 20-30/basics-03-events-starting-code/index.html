      <!-- I can use $event to target the default event object even where there's other arguments
        
        was having issue with v-on:input, realized it was because spacing input goes directly after colon -->

      <!-- v-on = I want to listen to this input event in the input element 
        - best event to listen to on html element 
        - default dom event available on input elements
      
      
      Parts rerendered by browser flashes, only parts that change the code are rerendered on the screen
    if Vue would update the entire screen whenever something changed somewhere, this would be bad for performance
  instead vue is smart and sees that with every keystroke on the name changes and hence it 
only finds the places that use the name, in this case the P tag and updates that
The rest is left untouced and performance is improved 


Note default event object
  - could have scenario need to call method explicity on our own
for example because we need to pass another argument 
e.g. second name is lastName

problem with this is we no longer get default event ojbect as first arguemnt
to pass that in there's a special variable we can use 

it's $event - reserved name, variable given to us to give access to build in default event object
which we get automatically by the browser 
so we can use it in the code and still pass it in as a first argument to set name 
if we wanted to 

Whenever we find outselves using an arugemnt here and can't just point to the object, 
we can access it with the $event 
Sometimes you need access to the built in object automatically but then also access the code explcitly 
to pass in our own arguments.

      <p> Your Name: {{ confirmedName }} </p>
      <form v-on:submit.prevent="submitForm">

        <!-- .prevent is a event modifier - full list in official docs 
        prevent 
      
      which can be done in javascript (submitForm(){ alert ('submitted'); it replaces that by just doing modifer})
    this can also extend to buttons
  
  v.on:click.right - you only want reaction to right click  (left, middle, etc)
