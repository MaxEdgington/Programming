    <section id="events">
      <h2>Events in Action</h2>
      <button v-on:click="add(10)">Add 10</button>
      <button v-on:click="reduce(5)">Subtract 5</button>
      <p>Result: {{ counter }}</p>
      <input type="text" v-model="name">
      <!-- goal is to have another button where we say RESET INPUT - resets input in iput element 
      
      We could use v-bind:value="name" to reset the value - name is reflected in input 
    if we now go to resetInput  - the empty value will be related to the input and it will go back to an empty string
  small issues because we still have +lastname in setName - lets get rid of last name and just store what user enters in ever keystroke - reflect name back to input and connect button -->
   <button v-on:click="resetInput"> Reset Input</button>
      <p>Your Name: {{ fullName }}</p>

      <!-- inputs where you dont just want value user entered but you want to set the value of the input 
      so you can reset it with a button or with any other logic you have on your page  
    and you can then achieve this by not just listening to the input 
    but by sending the stored value back into the input by binding the value property 
  
  Vue has a shortcut for this - special built in directive that simplifies this 
   if you bind the value and listen to input changes on input you can get rid of all of what's there
  both of the value binding and input event listening, and instead add a new directive on the input
  v-model!!
    v-model simply wants the data property it should manage for you, in our case the name property 
  the name property is now managed by vue such that's it's updated on the input event and then name
property's value is then sent back into the input element
V-model is a shortcut for v-bind:value and v-on: input 
this is a concept called two way binding
communicating in both ways
Listening to an event coming out of the input element to the input event 
and at the same time we're writing the value back to the input element through it's value 
property. 
This is useful, it makes getting user input and updating it much easier, less code and 
absolutely a pattern and directive you should keep in mind-->
